Such duplication creates additional maintenance requirements for synchronization (at a minimum) and often is a source for errors (i.e., when model and UI disagree). Adding to the difficulties, typical UI implementations often tangle multiple concerns together such as presentation, validation, layout, security, etc. In our talk, we present our approach to deal with UI employing aspect-oriented design, code-base inspection and UI generation. Our approaches considerably reduces development and maintenance efforts and separates different concerns. Furthermore, it supports the design of Adaptive User Interfaces that adjust the UI to user's capabilities, skills, origin, rights, browsing device, etc. We provide a demonstration of a library JFormBuilder that utilizes our approach and is ready to use with your Java EE application.</p>"}, {"end": "14:05", "room": "#Lecture room D1", "language": "EN", "tags": ["Cloud"], "timestamp": 1361708400, "topic": "Antoni Segura Puimedon - oVirt Networking", "start": "13:20", "speaker": "Antoni Segura Puimedon", "location": "MUNI", "date": "2013-02-24", "timestamp_end": 1361711100, "type": "talk", "description": "<p>This talk will give an overview of the networking model that is used by the open virtual datacenter management platform called oVirt.

What are the benefits over  (server-side) CMSes? How can static be dynamic?
